ABSTRACT

We are exposed to a great deal of music. As a result, many people have a desire to learn to play music. However, it takes a long time to master the instrument. Many people give up in this process. We want to provide a sense of accomplishment by providing an easy musical 
score of the song they want. If so, more people will be able to continue learning. We used the GTTM dataset(https://gttm.jp/gttm/database/) to create an easy score ground truth dataset. We propose a LSTM model that provides easy score.
